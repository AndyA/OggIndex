Index in Skeleton Spec.

Skeleton header:

1.  Identifier: 8 bytes, "fishead\0".
2.  Version major: 2 Byte unsigned integer signifying the major (3)
3.  Version minor: 2 Byte unsigned integer signifying the minor (1)
4.  Presentationtime numerator: 8 Byte signed integer
5.  Presentationtime denominator: 8 Byte signed integer
6.  Basetime numerator: 8 Byte signed integer
7.  Basetime denominator: 8 Byte signed integer
8.  UTC [ISO8601]: a 20 Byte string containing a UTC time
9.  [NEW] Start time, the presentation time in milliseconds of the
    first sample in the media. 8 byte signed integer, -1 if unknown.
    Note that samples between the Start time and the Presentationtime
    are supposed to be skipped.
10. [NEW] End time, the end time of the last sample in the media.
    8 byte signed integer, -1 if unknown.
11. [NEW] The length of the segment, in bytes: 8 byte signed integer,
    -1 if unknown.

Skeleton 'fisbone\0' packets unchanged, one per stream.

[NEW] Skeleton index packets. There should be one per content stream:

1. Identifier 6 bytes: "index\0"
2. The serialno of the stream as a 4 byte field.
3. The number of keypoints in the index packet, 'n' as a 4 byte
   unsigned integer. This can be 0.
4. 'n' key points, each of which contain, in the following order:
    - the page's byte offset as an 8 byte unsigned integer, followed by
    - the checksum of the page found at the offset, as a 4 byte field,
      followed by
    - the presentation time in milliseconds of the key point, as an 8
      byte unsigned integer.
